iPod is a web application developed using React.js that simulates the functionality of an iPod. It provides users with an interactive menu system, allowing them to navigate through various options such as Settings, Games, and Music. The iPod app offers the following functionalities:

Features
-> Build a menu of options with Settings, Games, Music, etc.
-> Clicking the center button allows users to go inside the selected menu.
-> Clicking on a specific menu item hides the menu and opens a screen corresponding to that option (e.g., Settings, Games).
-> Click and hold on the circular menu, then move the mouse in a circular fashion within the menu boundary to navigate through the options.
-> Clicking on the "Menu" option takes the user back to the main menu.
